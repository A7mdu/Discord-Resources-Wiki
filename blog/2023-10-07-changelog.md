**Introducing new project maintainer and lead**

Hello everyone. As you might have noticed, this project has been drifting for some quite time now and getting little to none updates. But that will change today.

As of today, I will be taking over as project lead and maintainer. Nothing major will change.

GitHub will be moved to a new org, since the old was locked behind Rydix account and they are no where to be seen.

Thats pretty much it. Have nice day!
